{% else %}
<p>GSoC contributors are encouraged to post something every week.  We do this for two reasons: firstly, to help the Python org admins tell that you're active and still on track, and secondly to help the wider Python community understand what our GSoC contributors are doing.

<p>Python recommends that you answer the following questions in your post:

<br />
&emsp;1. What did you do this week?<br />
&emsp;2. What is coming up next?<br />
&emsp;3. Did you get stuck anywhere?<br />
<br />

<p>These answers can be very short or you can go into longer detail about the project.  Longer posts help the wider Python community understand what work is being done as part of Google Summer of Code, shorter posts can function as simple status reports.
